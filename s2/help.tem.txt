This is a command line PHP script that expects one option

	Usage: 
	answer.php <option>
	<option> can be a path to a valid file that contains a single line of text
	which [the text] will be filtered and compacted as specified:
	1) the output will be only alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z)
	2) the output will remove any adjacent alphanumeric duplicates,
	including duplicates separated by non- alphanumeric characters.
	This program assumes that the input (both file path and contents) provided
	will be from the ASCII character set.
