This is a command line PHP script that expects one option

	Usage: 
	answer.php <option>
	<option> can be a path to a valid file that has two integers separated by
	spaces. The program will output only integers that exist in the range
	between these two numbers where the sum of all the digits is evenly
	divisible by four. Additionally, the program will output an asterisk ("*")
	next to the integer if the sum of its digits is also evenly divisible by
	eight. Each number will be outputted on a separate line.
